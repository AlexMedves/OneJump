#  Hello! And welcome to my project!  
<H6>(Which at the minute is called OneJump, we'll see about the future)</H6>


Currently the game is not realistically in Version 0.00 per se, as I have worked on it for a little bit before adding it to a github repo.
But for the sake of everything on here looking neat, the version numbers will start from 0.00, although you and I both know that is not true :/
(Also to help out, features I added will be put in chronological order of me adding them, this doesn't really help you, as much as it helps me realize where my spaghetti was ruined.)

To keep things interesting, I will also add the playlists or music I listened to while creating a new version for OneJump, just because I thought it would be fun, and who knows, maybe you find something you like.
That list will therefore reside here:

<H3>Description</H3>
Overall, I didn't have too much trouble implementing everything so far, fingers crossed it stays that way. The values mentioned above are always subject to change, but I won't bore you with the exact values I use.
If you really want to see the values, you can simply access them within my scripts and/or download the project to see editor specific set values.
That's all really. Thank you for checking out my repo, I appreciate it.
